                                In the year 2020 we all learned a lot about ourselves as well as the world around us. Often, focusing on the negative is easier than focusing on the positive. Because of that, the team at Smug Sheep wanted to provide a space to share the good in your life, no matter how big or small, in a safe anonymous environment. Maybe a stranger bought your groceries or maybe your neighbor just happened to bring in your plants before the big storm...either way it deserves recognition! So hop on over the the Smug Sheep feed, join the flock, and start shearing that negativity away one kind story at a time.
